## Usage

This plugin provides a Field method called `transformUrls()`. You can use it on any field â€“ most likely you want to use it for writer fields. The method searches for uuid links (e.g. `/@/page/vnEifKM2ECWtLyyq`) and transforms them to an URL with the full path (e.g. `https://example.com/lorem/ipsum`).

```php
<?= $block->text()->transformUrls() ?>
```

If the page/file is not found by the UUID, the link will not be changed. If the debug mode is activated it will throw an error.
